I created this series for Valentine's day but do we really need a day to say how we feel? 21 years ago on Valentine’s day, Derek and I had only been together for a month and a half. I was never really into Valentine’s day or teddy bears holding red satin hearts etc. I printed out a medical photo of a human heart and drew a crayon arrow through it and made a card from it.  I guess he liked it because he stuck around!   

“We’re all a little weird. And life is a little weird. And when we find someone whose weirdness is compatible with ours, we join up with them and fall into mutually satisfying weirdness–and call it love - true love.”
Robert Fulghum
