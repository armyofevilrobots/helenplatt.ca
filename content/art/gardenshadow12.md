The light blue one is still available!

I found inspiration for this series in the walls of heritage homes. Layers of paint, wallpaper and hidden treasures, hint at the lives, and stories that have gone before.

Each piece in this series is created with layer upon layer of collage, painting, cut birch panel, ink and paint.

Price does not include tax or shipping.
