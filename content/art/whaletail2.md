Living on the northwest coast, I'm lucky enough to see whales quite often! One of my favorites is the humpback with their crinkly edges to their flukes and fins. Made from laser cut birch panel and ink. Price does not include tax or shipping. Sold out.
# Several of the colours shown are sold out, commissions are welcome!
