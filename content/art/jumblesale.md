Jumble Sale is made with laser off cuts! When the lasercutter cuts out a project, the offcuts fall below into a waste collection area. Instead of throwing them away, I save them up to use in a new artwork! New pieces will show up here every once in a while and they are always different so keep checking back!  Laser cut birch on cradled panel. Price does not include tax or shipping.
