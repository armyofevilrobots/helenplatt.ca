I created this Mixed media piece as part of my Heart of Gold Series (the rest of the series can be found in the Laser Cut Gallery)  

The text in the piece reads  "I love thee, I love but thee! With a love that shall not die, Till the sun grows cold, And the stars are old" From Bedouin Love Song by Bayard Taylor
