## Looking for a custom project?

Thanks so much for your interest! If there's something on my website that you see that you'd like in a different size or colour, please reach out and I'd be happy to do what I can! For complete custom work, although I love and appreciate your enthusiasm and support, unfortunately I'm not able to take on fully custom projects at this time. 
Each laser cut art piece takes a great deal of time to create. Starting with my initial pencil drawing,  recreating the artwork in digital form, then creating in 3D and setting up all files for either the CNC machine, 3D printer or laser cutter, sometimes all three!
The last step is the actual creation of the piece, each one being created with great care and detail. It’s only by offering limited editions that makes this process viable and keeps the pricing affordable. To create a one off piece would increase the cost significantly.
Hopefully you’ll find something you love in the gallery pages, and if not, don’t hesitate to reach out as I only list a few of the pieces I’ve made here. You never know, I may have what you’re looking for in my studio! Also, check back often as I'm always creating new pieces.
