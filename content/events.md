#### 2020 - Oct. 27 to Dec. 8

I’m so happy to have my artwork hanging in the Gibsons Public Market from Oct 27 - Dec 8  along with artwork by David Emerson Hall. It’s a great spot to visit during stormy fall weather as it’s indoors. It also has loads of Christmas shopping ideas with an array of gourmet shops as well as the Nicholas Sonntag Marine Education Centre. If you haven’t been, it’s well worth a visit!
