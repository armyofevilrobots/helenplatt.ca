#### 2021 - Oct. 5 to Nov. 7th

So much going on at the Gibsons Public Market and I'm so happy to get to show here again this year! The show will be up October 5th to November 7th with stunning artwork by David Emerson Hall along with many of my own new works. Escape the stormy fall weather, check out some art, visit the marine center and get all your holiday shopping done at the market. If you haven’t been, it’s well worth a visit!

#### SUNSHINE COAST ART CRAWL!!! October 22nd to 24th

So excited I can barely contain myself! I'll be a venue in the art crawl this year for my very first time! I've been busy creating loads of new pieces including artworks of all sizes, jewellery and greeting cards. There will be something for everyone! My venue will be set up mostly outdoors with a tent and we have lots of parking. I'll also be doing a prize giveaway! I can wait to see you all there!
