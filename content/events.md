#### 2022 SUNSHINE COAST ART CRAWL!!! October 21st to 23rd

My second year in the crawl! Bigger and better than ever! Last year was amazing and the turn out of people was beyond what I had hoped for. Thank you to everyone who came last year and I hope to see you this year!

This year I'm excited to be a part of the <B>HENDERSON HOT SPOT!</B> Our little corner of Roberts Creek is bursting with artists so it's a fantastic spot to stop to hit lots of studios in one go. Plus we are right beside Henderson Beach for a quick break to watch the waves. We have loads of parking and I'll be doing a prize giveaway!

Look for me on the Sunshine Coast Art Crawl Map, I'm venue #84 in xwesam/Roberts Creek. I can't wait to see you all there!
